# STURMv0.1
A mathematica notebook to perform Sturm Chain analysis on polynomials of arbitrary order and find the number of real roots in a given interval.
The code is demonstated using a physical model of axisymmetric accretion onto a non-rotating black hole with Novikov-Thorne disc geometry.
The given polynomial can be replaced with polynomials of any given order. Blocks are assigned for defining system parameters related to any physical model
with their admissible ranges and step sizes. The code generates output data files containing the parameter values associated with a particular number of real roots.
